# High John the Conqueror 

One of the most prominent voices in the historiography about High John the Conqueror has come from Zora Neale Hurston and her seminal work High John de Conquer. By connecting High John the Conqueror to the folkloric personification of the trickster, Hurston gives High John the Conqueror a mythical status that is able to be summoned and used by any who are able to conjure his spirit.

Through Hurston’s connection of High John the Conqueror and the trickster figure, Hurston details the situations in which High John the Conqueror has outwitted his slave owner, which in turn made the lives of his and the other slaves around him better. Better known as the “John and Old Master” tales, Hurston repurposes this into a juxtaposition of African spirituality and African strength. For example, one tale shows how John was able to cook the pigs that were reserved for his master. Realizing that John was up to something, the master went to John’s residence where the decadence of the pig that was cooking in his home filled the air. The master demanded that John show him what is in the pot that he was cooking with. John replied, “Well, Massa, I put this in here a possum, but if it comes out a pig, it ain’t no fault of mine.” The master could not help but laugh, which he then gave John and the master’s other slaves roasted pig to eat.

While Hurston has become a prominent contributor to the identity of High John the Conqueror, recent studies by Carolyn Morrow Long have tried to find other answers and sources to High John the Conqueror. While Long also attributed Hurston for the main identity of High John the Conqueror, Long also examines several other possibilities for the creation of High John the Conqueror. One possibility is through the manifestation of a Yoruba/Dahomean deity that was brought to Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, such as Shangó, the spirit of thunder, lightning, fire, and passion, or Eleguá, the divine trickster. However, there is a stronger possibility that Long examines that connects High John the Conqueror to the Kongo people of West Africa. Traditional West African religions believe that every natural object contains a spirit that dwells inside of it. For the Kongo people, this spirit is called mooyo, which is where the African-American term mojo comes from, which in turn is defined as a lucky charm. High John the Conqueror can be all of these things or none of them. For it is not who High John the Conqueror is, but how High John the Conqueror is used that is important for discussion and study. To use High John the Conqueror, the concepts of mojo and lucky charms are key to conjuring his presence, which can only be done by using the root of where he rested his spirit: John the Conqueror root.

# John the Conqueror Root
_Ipomoea purga_ is described as a vine that can reach heights of 12 feet (3.7 m). When fresh, the root is black externally, white and milky within, and varies in size according to its age. It has heart shaped leaves and purple trumpet like flowers. _Ipomoea purga_ is rather difficult to break down, but if triturated with cream of tartar, sugar of milk, or other hard salts, the process of pulverization is much easier, and the powder rendered much finer. When in powder form in order to ingest, the color is a pale grayish brown. _Ipomoea purga_ is native to Mexico and it is naturalized in other parts of the neotropics.

## Bolsas de Mandingas in African Brazil

The power of luck in the African diaspora was a means in which to protect themselves in their everyday life manifested through African healers’ use of talismans, rituals, and charms. The institution of slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade facilitated a proxy for African slaves to continue their traditional ways of acquiring luck so that they may be protected and endure the daily berating of slavery. Near the end of the seventeenth century and largely into the eighteenth century, the most common use of talismans in the African diaspora in Brazil was the bolsa de mandinga. The makeup of bolsas were quite simple: they were typically made of a pouch that was made of cloth or leather, worn around the neck on a string, and contained any number of substances inside of them, which included Christian orations, rocks, sticks, roots, and so on. No bolsa were the same, for example, one bolsa was able to give its wearer protection from a slave owner and their beatings, while another bolsa was worn to be able to give its wearer luck to win games. The concept of bolsas, however, were not exclusive to only Africa and African healers. Bolsas were also used by the Portuguese dating as far back as the Middle Ages, yet, became distinguished as bolsas de mandingas as their use became more prominent by the African diaspora as a way to identify that Africans were using bolsas on their own terms.

## Slave Narratives and WPA Narratives

The case for John the Conqueror root being used as a means for fighting back against slave owners can be seen in several Works Progress Administration (WPA) narratives and autobiographies written by slaves during 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the most significant instances of a charm being used as a way to stop abuses from a slave owner can be seen in Frederick Douglass’ autobiography Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. While Douglass does not mention John the Conqueror root by name, his brief passage about using a charm displays some of the same characteristics that John the Conqueror root shares and how it protected him from his owner Mr. Covey. Douglass writes: 
	I found Sandy an old adviser. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; 		but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was 	a certain root, which if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right 		side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man to whip me. He 		said he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had never received a blow, 		and never expected to while he carried it.
The root that Douglass carried on his right side had its desired effect. Once Douglass returned home, Covey spoke to him in a kind manner and let him continue his day unabated. However, by the next day the root’s effect had worn off and a severe fight broke out between Douglass and Covey, leading to Douglass getting the upper hand and winning the fight. Yet this did not lead to Douglass getting whipped or punished for this behavior or any other time after that. Roots had a considerable ability to effect change. While Douglass did not believe that the root that his conjure doctor, Sandy, had given him would lead to such a change in behavior in his owner, Douglass had to resign to the fact that it may have
